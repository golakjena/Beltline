					<p>With over 15 million Americans considered morbidly obese and <strong>bariatric weight loss surgery </strong>proving to be the most effective long-term treatment for this condition to date, it is no surprise that the demand for these procedures is increasing. Along with the increase in procedures has come a streamlining of the process and innovation to lower surgical risks and recovery times. If you are struggling to lose weight, your healthcare provider may recommend outpatient bariatric weight loss surgery to help you achieve substantial weight loss.</p>
					<p>Most outpatient bariatric weight loss surgeries are performed laparoscopically, involving several small 1.5-2.5 cm incisions into the abdomen, allowing doctors to insert small cameras which enable them to see inside your abdomen during the procedure. These procedures are designed to minimize pain, recovery time and the length of your hospital stay. In fact, many of these surgeries are now being performed in outpatient surgery centers.</p>
					<p>Outpatient bariatric surgery is not a one-size-fits-all procedure, and you should thoughtfully explore the different options available with your healthcare professional. While the gastric banding procedures are still the most common type of <strong>outpatient weight loss surgery</strong>performed, there are now various options available to patients seeking this type of surgery. To schedule a consultation with a surgeon in that is an expert in <em>bariatric weight loss surgery</em>, call <strong>(470) 419-4380</strong> or <strong>contact us online</strong>.</p>
					<h5>Types of Outpatient Bariatric Surgery</h5>
					<p><strong>Gastric Banding</strong>: Commonly referred to as Lap-Band surgery, this minimally invasive procedure can usually be done on an outpatient basis, with the procedure taking less than an hour and recovery time averaging less than a week. In outpatient lap band surgery the doctor places an inflatable silicone band around the top portion of the stomach that attaches to a small port that is placed under the skin on the abdomen. The band decreases the size of the stomach cavity to restrict the amount of food that you can ingest at one sitting. It allows you to feel full quicker and longer and helps decrease appetite. The abdominal port is used to increase or decrease inflation of the band depending on your specific needs at different times.</p>
					<p><strong>Intragastric Balloon System</strong>: This is a non-surgical weight-loss procedure that requires no incisions. In this procedure a deflated balloon is inserted into the stomach through a tube placed down your throat where it is then inflated to roughly the size of a grapefruit and left in your stomach cavity for an average of six months. The surgery has been shown to increase feelings of fullness, thereby curbing appetite and leading to weight loss.</p>
					<p><strong>Aspire Assist</strong>: This procedure is a new type of bariatric surgery that works differently from traditional outpatient bariatric surgery. Instead of focusing on decreased stomach capacity or increased digestion time, the Aspire Assist system places a small device into your stomach during a minimally invasive, 15-minute procedure that attaches to a catheter attached to a port in your abdomen. After eating a regular meal, you attach a device to the catheter port allowing you to remove 30% of food ingested before digestion even begins. The procedure is done under twilight anesthesia, being the only outpatient bariatric surgery that does not involve general anesthesia. It is also fully reversible and can be removed at any time with no permanent damage to your gastrointestinal anatomy.</p>
					<p><strong>Maestro Rechargeable System</strong>: Unlike other outpatient weight loss surgeries, this procedure doesn't involve the stomach cavity. This is a pace-maker type of device that is inserted under general anesthesia in an outpatient procedure that lasts approximately one hour to an hour and a half. The implant is designed to send electrical signals to the vagus nerve, which connects your stomach to your brain, in five minutes on, five minutes off cycles during your waking hours. The electrical impulse is designed to signal your brain that you are full.</p>
					<h5>Candidates for Outpatient Bariatric Surgery</h5>
					<p>Outpatient bariatric surgery is not for everyone and you must meet various criteria in order to qualify for surgery. Typically, a candidate must meet the following requirements:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Have a BMI (Body Mass Index), of 40+, or a BMI of 30+ with at least one medical condition secondary to obesity such as diabetes or high blood pressure</li>
						<li>Be over 18 and not pregnant with no evidence of excessive alcohol consumption</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Your healthcare provider will also want to ensure you have made multiple attempts at natural, non-surgical weight loss in the past without achieving long-term positive results. You must be willing to make major changes to your lifestyle, including changes in eating habits, diet and exercise.</p>
					<h5>What to Expect from Outpatient Weight Loss Surgery</h5>
					<p><strong>Bariatric weight loss surgery </strong>has proven to be the most effective long-term weight loss treatment to date. Although results can vary widely from procedure to procedure - and between patients - all of the above procedures are done in outpatient setting that require very little procedure time and usually take less than a week of post-op recovery time. These procedures are designed to get you up and moving the same day and back to a normal daily routine and work within a week. There is minimal pain associated with these procedures and the risk of the outpatient procedures is much less than with more invasive gastric bypass inpatient procedures.</p>
					<p>For those who undergo an outpatient weight loss procedure, 30-50% or more of their excess weight within the first two years is typically lost, depending on the specific procedure and the adherence to a healthy lifestyle following weight loss surgery. This extreme loss of excess weight leads to decreased risks of those diseases associated with morbid obesity such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, etc. At least 95% of patients who have had weight loss surgery report an increase in their quality of life following the procedure.</p>
					<p>While serious side effects are rare, there is risk involved with any surgical procedure, including:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Constipation or other changes in bowel habits, usually temporary</li>
						<li>Dumping syndrome, caused by meals or drinks with high sugar content leading to nausea and/ or vomiting</li>
						<li>Infection, typically involving incision wounds</li>
						<li>Gallstones, which can be fairly common in cases of rapid, excessive weight loss</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you suffering from morbid obesity, outpatient bariatric weight loss surgery can be a safe and effective way to treat your condition.
