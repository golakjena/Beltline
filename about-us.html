									<p>Dr. Procter has been focusing on minimally invasive approaches to bariatric surgery for his entire career. Having performed the first robotic-assisted cholecystectomy in the state in 2008, he later became one of the first bariatric surgeons to adopt the fully robotic approach to the sleeve gastrectomy, roux-en Y gastric bypass, and duodenal switch. He has been performing bariatric surgery since 2007, and started Beltline Bariatric and Surgical Group in 2016.</p>
									<p>He is married to a lovely wife and has three wonderful boys with whom he enjoys golfing. In addition to his clinical practice, Dr. Procter promotes weight loss surgery awareness on TLC’s “Family by the Ton.”</p>

She also helps our patients after surgery as they adjust to their new lifestyle and routines. Robbi is passionate about helping patients not only lose weight, but finding themselves in happy and healthy bodies that are cared for from the inside out. Her favorite part of the job is when a patient comes in filled with joy because of what their new body can do for them, whether that be standing longer in the kitchen to cook or simply taking a set of stairs. In her personal life Robbi enjoys spending time with her bulldog Edith and fostering dogs in need. She loves to take attend spin class, go to yoga, and find new recipes to cook.</p>

She strives to be the change that she wants to see in the world each day. She empowers and encourages every individual life that crosses her path, and she strives to teach our patients about living a better life through health, nutrition, fitness, and spirituality to ensure they have the best quality of life after surgery. In her best effort, she will provide the tools and reinforcements for patients to achieve all goals and aspirations that they set forth for themselves.</p>
									<p>She was led to this practice to achieve great things and grow in so many ways than one. She is beyond words and emotions to work with a doctor with so much drive, determination, selflessness, and love for others and a staff that makes an office feel like home.
