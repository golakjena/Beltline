				<div class="blogDetails clearfix">
					<p>Looking for a non-surgical weight loss tool to help jumpstart your weight loss efforts? Have you been unable to achieve the results you want through diet and exercise alone? If so, the gastric balloon may be an option for you.</p>
					<p>Here at Beltline Bariatric, we use the ReShape gastric balloon system - a safe, FDA-approved treatment option for patients who have a stable body mass index between 30 and 40, and who have been unable to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight through exercise and diet alone.</p>
					<h5>What Is A Gastric Balloon for Weight Loss?</h5>
					<p>A gastric balloon is a medical-grade silicone balloon that works by taking up space in your stomach, helping you to feel full on less food.</p>
					<p>As an FDA-approved device used to promotes portion control and development of healthy eating habits, the gastric balloon is placed inside your stomach by a bariatric surgeon via your throat. No incisions are needed, and only mild sedation is required.</p>
					<p>The gastric balloon takes takes approximately 30 minutes to place, and it can be left in for up to 6 months.</p>
					<h5>What Gastric Balloon System Does Beltline Use?</h5>
					<p>At Beltline Bariatric, we use the FDA-approved ReShape gastric balloon system, which is made up of two interconnected soft, medical-grade silicone balloons that are filled with sterile saline. When inflated with saline water, gastric balloons are about the same size as a two small grapefruits - this helps to create a 'full' sensation to promote reduced calorie intake, and in turn result in weight loss.</p>
					<p>During the first six months of the ReShape weight loss program, the &ldquo;Jump Start&rdquo; phase,Â  the balloons remain in place inside the stomach. During this critical phase, patients are required to follow a specific, calorie-restricted diet designed to support the development of healthy eating habits. Patients are also encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle by adding a regular exercise program to their daily routine.</p>
					<p>Once the ReShape balloons are removed, patients continue of the diet and exercise program for another six months to support permanent, lasting lifestyle changes designed to promote lasting results.</p>
					<h5>What Are The Advantages Of A Gastric Balloon?</h5>
					<p>Unlike other medical weight loss procedures that are performed under general anesthesia, the gastric balloon is fully reversible and non-permanent. Once placed, it must be removed within six months by a bariatric surgeon, however, it can be removed at any time prior to the six month time limit.</p>
					<p>Because the gastric balloon leaves the entire digestive system in-tact, this treatment does not impact absorption of nutrients, so there is no risk of developing malnutrition or a nutrient deficiency while the balloon is in place.</p>
					<p>To ensure patient safety, a blue dye is integrated into the saline - this will show up in urine in the highly unlikely event that one of the balloons breaks while in place.</p>
					<h5>Who Is Eligible For The ReShape Gastric Balloon?</h5>
					<p>Adults aged 18 and over who have a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, along with at least one comorbid condition related to obesity may be eligible for treatment using the ReShape gastric balloon. Candidates for the ReShape gastric balloon cannot:</p>
					<ul class="listing">
						<li>Have undergone previous weight loss surgery or other procedures that impacted their stomach structure; </li>
						<li>Take anti-inflammatory medications, anticoagulants, prescription aspirin or other gastric irritants </li>
						<li>Be pregnant or breastfeeding, or likely to become pregnant while the balloon is in place </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Patients who want to pursue treatment with the ReShape gastric balloon system need to be willing to commit to lifestyle changes, including regular consultations with their bariatric care team.</p>
					<h5>Is A Gastric Balloon Right For Me?</h5>
					<p>If you are seeking a non-surgical treatment option for obesity that includes ongoing dietary and lifestyle support from a team of experienced, compassionate medical weight loss experts, the ReShape gastric balloon system may be right for you.</p>
					<p>During clinical trials, patients with the ReShape gastric balloon lost an average of three times as much excess weight as those who used diet modification and exercise alone. As with all forms of obesity treatment, individual patient outcomes will vary based on a number of factors, including genetics, diet, exercise, comorbid conditions, and the compatibility of the patient with the treatment.</p>
					<h5>Will Insurance Cover Gastric Balloon?</h5>
					<p>Because gastric balloon is a non-surgical, reversible weight loss procedure, ReShape is usually not covered by insurance.</p>
					<p>Here at Beltline, we accept both cash payments and approved medical financing for all of our bariatric services, including the gastric balloon procedure.</p>
